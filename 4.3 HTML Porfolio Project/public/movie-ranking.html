<h1>My favourite animes</h1>
<h2>This is my top 3</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Bleach</h3>
<p>My favourite anime at all. Has a lot of cons. But I really enjoy.</p>

<h3>2. Death Note</h3>
<p>Very different from the other one. Has a special way to make you think about justice.</p>

<h3>3. Dragon Ball</h3>
<p>Is simple and fun. It's one of the best in fighting scenes.</p>
